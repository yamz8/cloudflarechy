# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First release.

- Bar widget with a themed cloud mark, and a dot when Development Mode or Under
  Attack Mode is on or a tunnel is down or degraded.
- Panel: 24h requests, cache ratio, bytes served, unique visitors and threats,
  with one bar per hour showing the cached share.
- Zone controls: Development Mode with its countdown, Under Attack Mode that
  restores the previous security level when switched off, and Purge cache
  behind a confirmation.
- Cloudflare Tunnels with status and connection count; five most recent Workers.
- Zone picker for accounts with more than one zone; the `zone` setting pins one.
- `bin/cloudflarechy`: the whole data layer as a JSON-per-command CLI, with a
  short-lived read cache and a `--fresh` bypass.
- Degrades one section at a time when a token lacks a scope, and names the
  scope that is missing.
